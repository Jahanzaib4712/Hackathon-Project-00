ðŸŽ¯ Hackathon Challenge: Pixel-Perfect Website Clone
This project was created as part of a 24-hour Hackathon challenge, where the goal was to replicate a Figma design into a fully functional website with pixel-perfect precision.

ðŸ’¡ Challenge Objective
The task was to translate a given Figma file into a website that matches the design in every detail â€” from layout and typography to colors and spacing. The challenge tested our skills in:

HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for precise design implementation
Responsiveness to ensure the design adapts beautifully across devices
Attention to Detail for a perfect replica
ðŸ•’ Time Constraint
We had just 24 hours to complete the project, making time management and quick decision-making essential.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights
Fully responsive and pixel-perfect design
Matches the original Figma prototype exactly
Built using best practices in web development
Completed within the tight 24-hour deadline
ðŸŒŸ Experience
This project was a thrilling experience that pushed my design and coding skills to the next level. The challenge reinforced the importance of precision, focus, and efficient workflows under pressure.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback! ðŸ˜Š
