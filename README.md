ðŸŽ¯ Hackathon Challenge: Pixel-Perfect Website Clone
This project was created as part of a 24-hour Hackathon challenge, where the goal was to replicate a Figma design into a fully functional website with pixel-perfect precision.

ðŸ’¡ Challenge Objective
The task was to translate a given Figma file into a website that matches the design in every detail â€” from layout and typography to colors and spacing. The challenge tested our skills in:

HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for precise design implementation
Responsiveness to ensure the design adapts beautifully across devices
Attention to Detail for a perfect replica
ðŸ•’ Time Constraint
We had just 24 hours to complete the project, making time management and quick decision-making essential.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights
Fully responsive and pixel-perfect design
Matches the original Figma prototype exactly
Built using best practices in web development
Completed within the tight 24-hour deadline
ðŸŒŸ Experience
This project was a thrilling experience that pushed my design and coding skills to the next level. The challenge reinforced the importance of precision, focus, and efficient workflows under pressure.
